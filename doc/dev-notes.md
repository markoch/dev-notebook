# Developer Notebook

This is my Developer Notebook!

t.b.d.

# Code Review Process

## The Light Pass

* Minimal changes
* Documentation added
* Unclear or Messy code
* Validate Error Handling
* Good commit message

## The Contextual Pass

* Functional Programming
* Limitted interaction to remote systems
* Valid code structure
* Tests added
* Add code review comments (also positive comments)

# Functional Programming Guidelines

* Immutability
* Separation
  * Separate calculation from execution
  * Keep side-effects minimal and perform them in a central place
* Composition
  * Plan for composing functions
  * Write function whose output will works as an input for many other functions
  * Keep signatures as simple as possible
* Conservation
  * Write generic functions
  * Avoid type specific functions
